This function applies the specified amount of damage in half-hearts to the executing entity.
```mcfunction
scoreboard players set @s smithed.damage 3    # Does 1.5 damage (3 half-hearts)
function #smithed.damage:entity/apply         # Apply the damage
```

* [`function #smithed.damage:entity/apply/armor`](apply/armor.md): Respects armor, protection, and resistance
* [`function #smithed.damage:entity/apply/explosion`](apply/explosion.md): Respects the same as `armor`, but blast protection as well
* [`function #smithed.damage:entity/apply/projectile`](apply/projectile.md): Respects the same as `armor`, but projectile protection as well
